* Design goals of Em Worker *

** Should use tcp rather than unix sockets for communication between processes

** Workers can be completely started/stopped on demand, out of process. In a nutshell, an 
   individual worker can be started/stopped from monit and can reconnect to master process.

** Worker and Server crashes should be handled gracefully and logged properly.

** Can be clustered
** Should be able to auto-spawn workers on demand.
